## **Description**
This is the project for week 6 at Epicodus to demonstrate proficiency in Asynchrony and APIs. It uses the currency exchange API from exchangerate-api.com/ and requires an API key.

## Complete Setup
- Clone this repository
- In the top level of the directory, create a new file named ".env" using the terminal command `touch .env`
- Go to the ExchangeRate-API website to register for a free API key: [ExchangeRate-API](exchangerate-api.com/)
- At the website, enter your email and click the "Get Free Key" button
- Create an account with your email, first name and a password and agree to the terms of use and click "Get Started!"
- Access you dashboard to find your unique API key
- Add your API key to the .env file by entering the line API_KEY={xxx} where the {xxx} should be replaced with your private key. Be sure to follow this exact naming convention, including capitalization, then save the file.
- Open the project in VS Code
- Run the following commands in the terminal to install packages with npm:
`$ npm install`
`$ npm run build`
`$ npm run start`
- After running the "start" script, the webpage should automatically open in your browser.
- Alternatively, after installation and bundling, you can run the application by opening ./dist/index.html in the browser if you do not need the live server.

Note: All source files are located in the ./src/ folder
